Induction with Inductive Types

Let's see a bit how how induction is called inductive types. 
For each inductive type, recursors are automatically instantiated. 
-/

#check Nat.rec
#check List.rec

example (a b c: ℕ) : exp (a*b) c = (exp a c) * exp b c := by 
  apply @Nat.rec (fun c => exp (a*b) c = ((exp a c) * exp b c))
  · simp [exp]
  · intro n ih 
    simp [exp]
    rw [ih]
    ac_rfl

/-

Using the recusors directly is not as ergnomic as some built in tactics 
of which there are few.

First, we have already seen that `match` can be used to argue via 
induction. 

Let's prove that our exponentiation function on ℕ is multiplicative in 
the base. 
-/

theorem mul_of_mul_base_exp (a b c : ℕ) : exp (a*b) c = (exp a c) * exp b c := by 
  match c with 
  | 0 => simp only [exp] 
  | z+1 => 
    simp only [exp,Nat.add]
    rw [mul_of_mul_base_exp a b z]
    ac_rfl

/-

In `mul_of_mul_base_exp`, we used induction at the step `rw [mul_of_mul_base_exp a b c]` 
since this presumes a proof of `mul_of_mul_base_exp a b c`.

Consider the following version using an anonymous `example`. 

example (a b c: ℕ) : exp (a*b) c = (exp a c) * exp b c := by 
  match c with 
  | 0 => simp only [exp] 
  | c+1 => 
    simp only [exp,Nat.add] 
    -- how do we call the inductive step without a name?
    sorry 

In this case, we can use `induction` or `induction'`.
